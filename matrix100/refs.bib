  abstract = {The branching algorithm is a fundamental technique for designing fast exponential-time algorithms to solve combinatorial optimization problems exactly. It divides the entire solution space into independent search branches using predetermined branching rules, and ignores the search on suboptimal branches to reduce the time complexity. The complexity of a branching algorithm is primarily determined by the branching rules it employs, which are often designed by human experts. In this paper, we show how to automate this process with a focus on the maximum independent set problem. The main contribution is an algorithm that efficiently generate optimal branching rules for a given sub-graph with tens of vertices. Its efficiency enables us to generate the branching rules on-the-fly, which is provably optimal and significantly reduces the number of branches compared to existing methods that rely on expert-designed branching rules. Numerical experiment on 3-regular graphs shows an average complexity of O(1.0441{\textasciicircum}n) can be achieved, better than any previous methods.},

Motivated by recent experiments with up to 289 qubits [Ebadi et al., Science 376, 1209 (2022)], we study the maximum-independent-set problem on unit-disk graphs with a broader range of classical solvers beyond the scope of the original paper. We carry out extensive numerical studies and assess problem hardness, using both exact and heuristic algorithms. We find that quasiplanar instances with Union-Jack-like connectivity can be solved to optimality for up to thousands of nodes within minutes, with both custom and generic commercial solvers on commodity hardware, without any instance-specific fine-tuning. We also perform a scaling analysis, showing that by relaxing the constraints on the classical simulated annealing algorithms considered in Ebadi et al., our implementation is competitive with the quantum algorithms. Conversely, instances with larger connectivity or less structure are shown to display a time-to-solution potentially orders of magnitudes larger. Based on these results, we propose protocols to systematically tune problem hardness, motivating experiments with Rydberg atom arrays on instances orders of magnitude harder (for established classical solvers) than previously studied.},

This model is the lattice version of the hard-disk system with increasing k corresponding to decreasing lattice spacing. While the hard-disk system is known to undergo a two-step freezing process with increasing density, the lattice model has been known to show only one transition. Here, based on Monte Carlo simulations and high-density expansions of the free energy and density, we argue that for k=4,10,11,14, the lattice model undergoes multiple transitions with increasing density. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we confirm the same for k=4,...,11. This, in turn, resolves an existing puzzle as to why the 4-NN model has a continuous transition against the expectation of a first-order transition. {\copyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown human-like reasoning abilities but still struggle with complex logical problems. This paper introduces a novel framework, Logic-LM, which integrates LLMs with symbolic solvers to improve logical problem-solving. Our method first utilizes LLMs to translate a natural language problem into a symbolic formulation. Afterward, a deterministic symbolic solver performs inference on the formulated problem. We also introduce a self-refinement module, which utilizes the symbolic solver's error messages to revise symbolic formalizations. We demonstrate Logic-LM's effectiveness on five logical reasoning datasets: ProofWriter, PrOntoQA, FOLIO, LogicalDeduction, and AR-LSAT. On average, Logic-LM achieves a significant performance boost of 39.2\% over using LLM alone with standard prompting and 18.4\% over LLM with chain-of-thought prompting. Our findings suggest that Logic-LM, by combining LLMs with symbolic logic, offers a promising avenue for faithful logical reasoning.

  abstract = {Integrating logical reasoning within deep learning architectures has been a major goal of modern AI systems. In this paper, we propose a new direction toward this goal by introducing a differentiable (smoothed) maximum satisfiability (MAXSAT) solver that can be integrated into the loop of larger deep learning systems. Our (approximate) solver is based upon a fast coordinate descent approach to solving the semidefinite program (SDP) associated with the MAXSAT problem. We show how to analytically differentiate through the solution to this SDP and efficiently solve the associated backward pass. We demonstrate that by integrating this solver into end-to-end learning systems, we can learn the logical structure of challenging problems in a minimally supervised fashion.}

  abstract = {We present NeuroSAT, a message passing neural network that learns to solve SAT problems after only being trained as a classifier to predict satisfiability. Although it is not competitive with state-of-the-art SAT solvers, NeuroSAT can solve problems that are substantially larger and more difficult than it ever saw during training by simply running for more iterations. Moreover, NeuroSAT generalizes to novel distributions; after training only on random SAT problems, at test time it can solve SAT problems encoding graph coloring, clique detection, dominating set, and vertex cover problems, all on a range of distributions over small random graphs.}

  abstract = {Proving mathematical theorems at the olympiad level represents a notable milestone in human-level automated reasoning, owing to their reputed difficulty among the world's best talents in pre-university mathematics. Current machine learning approaches, however, are not applicable to most mathematical domains owing to the high cost of translating human proofs into machine-verifiable format. The problem is even worse for geometry because of its unique translation challenges, resulting in severe scarcity of training data. We propose AlphaGeometry, a theorem prover for Euclidean plane geometry that sidesteps the need for human demonstrations by synthesizing millions of theorems and proofs across different levels of complexity. AlphaGeometry is a neuro-symbolic system that uses a neural language model, trained from scratch on our large-scale synthetic data, to guide a symbolic deduction engine through infinite branching points in challenging problems. On a test set of 30 latest olympiad-level problems, AlphaGeometry solves 25, outperforming the previous best method that solves ten and approaching the performance of an average International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) gold medallist. Notably, AlphaGeometry produces human-readable proofs, solves all geometry problems in the IMO 2000 and 2015 under human expert evaluation and discovers a generalized version of a translated IMO theorem in 2004.}

  abstract = {We present a unified exact tensor network approach to compute the ground state energy, identify the optimal configuration, and count the number of solutions for spin glasses. The method is based on tensor networks with the tropical algebra defined on the semiring of (R{$\cup$}\textbraceleft -{$\infty$}\textbraceright,{$\oplus$},{$\odot$}). Contracting the tropical tensor network gives the ground state energy; differentiating through the tensor network contraction gives the ground state configuration; mixing the tropical algebra and the ordinary algebra counts the ground state degeneracy. The approach brings together the concepts from graphical models, tensor networks, differentiable programming, and quantum circuit simulation, and easily utilizes the computational power of graphical processing units (GPUs). For applications, we compute the exact ground state energy of Ising spin glasses on square lattice up to 1024 spins, on cubic lattice up to 216 spins, and on three regular random graphs up to 220 spins, on a single GPU; we obtain exact ground state energy of \textpm J Ising spin glass on the chimera graph of D-Wave quantum annealer of 512 qubits in less than 100 s and investigate the exact value of the residual entropy of \textpm J spin glasses on the chimera graph; finally, we investigate ground-state energy and entropy of three-state Potts glasses on square lattices up to size 18\texttimes 18. Our approach provides baselines and benchmarks for exact algorithms for spin glasses and combinatorial optimization problems, and for evaluating heuristic algorithms and mean-field theories.},
